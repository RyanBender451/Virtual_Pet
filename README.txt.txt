This Project involves 3 classes
1) A main class in Program.cs
2) a VirtualPet class in VirtualPet.cs
3) a VirtZombie class in VirtZombie.cs


The main holds the loops for the pet and zombie pets in this game.
You choose the name of the pet and then you have choices to do based on the pets stats
the pet has 3 stats hunger, energy and fun/enjoyment.  
There are random ticks that is set by the virtualpet program.  
The zombie pet is your old pet but you turned it into a zombie.
The regular pet and zombie pets are different.  The regular pet has numerical values for it stats.
The Zombie pet stats are all string based and completely controlled by the virtzombie class.  
the only numerical stat for the zombie is the anger meter which is completely hidden from the user.
if the meter hits 5 the zombie kills the player and its game over.

I didn't use any ascii art in it because I ran out of ideas for that and i wanted to try to make the programs as unquie as possible.
I don't think this is my best work ever, I hit the programmer's version of writers block during the creating of this project.
